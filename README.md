### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

### Continued development

I'd like to learn how to keep the footer on the bottom of the screen, then have it disappear when the viewport gets vertically smaller. Right now when the viewport gets vertically smaller, the footer overlaps the main content.
