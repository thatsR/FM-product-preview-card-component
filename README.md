## My process

### Built with

- html
- css
- flexbox

### What I learned

I learned how to use padding and then utilize "justify-content: space-between" a bit better.

### Continued development

I'd like to learn how to keep the footer on the bottom of the screen, then have it disappear when the viewport gets vertically smaller. Right now when the viewport gets vertically smaller, the footer overlaps the main content.
